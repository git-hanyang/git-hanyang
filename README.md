## Hi there ðŸ‘‹<br>

### Welcome to my profile! <br>
My name is Han Yang, I'm currently looking for my first working experience as a junior web developer.:sunglasses: <br>

### About me <br>
I was an accountant/auditor for 4.5 years until April 2022, I then decided to have a career switch into software developer. <br>
It requires some great dedication and courage to do that, and believing is all I got. The main reason for this career switch is that  <br>
I find myself to have greater passion in this field as it requires constant learning and building new stuff. I like to work around creativity <br>
because it is fun, and it surely feels great to make new things happening!:kissing: <br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react redux, typescript and some php.  <br>

I have great dedication, motivation, but opportunity is all I need :heartpulse: <br>
